        title: "NICHD, R00HD103912",
        period: "04/2024 – 03/2027",
        role: "Principal Investigator",
        agency: "National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)",
        projectTitle: "Leveraging Artificial Intelligence To Develop Novel Tools For Studying Infant Brain Development",
        description: "This proposal leverages artificial intelligence and large-scale datasets to address unmet technical challenges in infant brain segmentation, to delineate the growth trajectories of brain structure/function and measure their relationship with neuro-cognitive functions, and to predict the developmental outcomes. Results from this study will address fundamental methodological limitations and fill critical knowledge gaps of early development, advancing efforts toward early identification of developmental delays and disorders.",
        amount: "2024-2027"

        title: "NIMH R01MH133313",
        period: "04/2024 – 03/2028",
        role: "Multiple Principal Investigator (with Dr. Jonathan Posner)",
        agency: "National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)",
        projectTitle: "Prenatal Maternal Obesity And Neurodevelopment: The Mediating Role Of The Microbiome And Metabolome",
        description: "Pre-pregnancy obesity has long been associated with indicators of impaired emotion regulation in children – e.g., increased rates of psychiatric disorders with emotion regulation deficits such as depressive and anxiety disorders. Our proposal aims to test the overarching mechanistic hypothesis that pre-pregnancy maternal obesity negatively influences emotion regulation and thus increases risk for psychopathology in children through its effects on the maternal gut microbiome and metabolome.",

        title: "Brain & Behavior Research Foundation",
        period: "01/2022 – 01/2025",
        role: "Principal Investigator",
        agency: "Brain & Behavior Research Foundation",
        projectTitle: "Adverse Impact Of In Utero SSRI Exposure On Offspring's Brain Myelination At Birth And Social Behavior At 12 Months",
        description: "The proposed project builds on an existing cohort (funded by NIMH) and leverages longitudinal assessment of maternal depression and family environment to investigate the impact of prenatal SSRI exposure on early brain development and behavioral outcomes.",
